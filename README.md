Persona pronoun management for SillyTavern. This extension adds a dedicated editor under Persona Management, quick presets (She/Her, He/Him, They/Them, It/Its) and prompt macros for the active persona (e.g., `{{pronoun.subjective}}`) with optional shorthand macros via settings.

Inspired by and partially ported from SillyTavern PR [#4542](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/pull/4542).

## Installation

```

## Features

- **Pronoun editor**
  - Appears under the persona description field in Persona Management.
  - Fields: subjective, objective, possessive determiner, possessive pronoun, reflexive.
  - Values are stored on the persona descriptor and persist with exports/backups.

- **Presets**
  - Quick-fill buttons: `She/Her`, `He/Him`, `They/Them`, `It/Its`.

- **Text replacer**
  - Accessible via Persona Management → Pronouns → Replace text with macros.
  - Paste any prompt or text to automatically swap matching pronouns with the active persona macros.

- **Macros** (usable anywhere macros are supported)
  - Persona macros:
    - `{{pronoun.subjective}}`
    - `{{pronoun.objective}}`
    - `{{pronoun.pos_det}}`  (possessive determiner)
    - `{{pronoun.pos_pro}}`  (possessive pronoun)
    - `{{pronoun.reflexive}}`
  - Shorthand aliases (disabled by default — enable at Settings → Extensions → Pronouns → Enable shorthand macros):
    - Subjective: `{{she}}`, `{{he}}`, `{{they}}`
    - Objective: `{{her}}`, `{{him}}`, `{{them}}`
    - Possessive determiner: `{{her_}}`, `{{his_}}`, `{{their_}}` (note the underscore)
    - Possessive pronoun: `{{hers}}`, `{{his}}`, `{{theirs}}`
    - Reflexive: `{{herself}}`, `{{himself}}`, `{{themself}}`
  - The info icons next to each field show the currently available macros (including shorthands if enabled).

- **Slash commands**
  - Commands include `/pronouns`, `/pronouns-presets`, `/pronouns-macros`, `/pronouns-text`, and `/pronouns-settings`. Slash command help in SillyTavern shows detailed descriptions.

### Terminology
- **Subjective**: she/he/they/it (used as subject)
- **Objective**: her/him/them/it (used as object)
- **Possessive determiner**: her/his/their/its (before nouns)
- **Possessive pronoun**: hers/his/theirs/its (stands alone)
- **Reflexive**: herself/himself/themself/itself
